We hypothesized that achieving glycemic control soon after admission, in both intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU settings, could affect outcomes in patients with COVID-19. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We analyzed pooled data from the Glytec national database including 1,544 patients with COVID-19 from 91 hospitals in 12 states. Patients were stratified according to achieved mean glucose category in mg/dL (£7.77, 7.83–10, 10.1–13.88, and >13.88 mmol/L; £140, 141–180, 181–250, and >250 mg/dL) during days 2–3 in non-ICU patients or on day 2 in ICU patients. We conducted a survival analysis to determine the association between glucose category and hospital mortality. RESULTS Overall, 18.1% (279/1,544) of patients died in the hospital. In non-ICU patients, severe hyperglycemia (blood glucose [BG] >13.88 mmol/L [250 mg/dL]) on days 2–3 was independently associated with high mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 7.17; 95% CI 2.62–19.62) compared with patients with BG <7.77 mmol/L (140 mg/dL). This relationship was not significant for admission glucose (HR 1.465; 95% CI 0.683– 3.143). In patients admitted directly to the ICU, severe hyperglycemia on admission was associated with increased mortality (adjusted HR 3.14; 95% CI 1.44–6.88). This relationship was not significant on day 2 (HR 1.40; 95% CI 0.53–3.69). Hypoglycemia (BG <70 mg/dL) was also associated with increased mortality (odds ratio 2.2; 95% CI 1.35–3.60). CONCLUSIONS Both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia were associated with poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Admission glucose was a strong predictor of death among patients directly admitted to the ICU. Severe hyperglycemia after admission was a strong predictor of death among non-ICU patients. © 2020 by the American Diabetes Association.",NA,glucose; adult; Article; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; death; diabetes mellitus; disease severity; female; glucose blood level; glycemic control; hospital mortality; hospital patient; human; hyperglycemia; hypoglycemia; intensive care unit; major clinical study; male; middle aged; prediction; retrospective study; survival analysis; clinical trial; diabetes mellitus; glycemic control; hospital; hospital patient; hospitalization; hyperglycemia; hypoglycemia; metabolism; multicenter study; risk factor; Adult; COVID-19; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Glycemic Control; Hospital Mortality; Hospitalization; Hospitals; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Hypoglycemia; Inpatients; Intensive Care Units; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors,"National Institutes of Health, NIH: U30 P30DK11102, UL1TR002378; AstraZeneca: 1K23GM128221-01A1, P30DK111024, P30DK111024-05S1; Roche; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS; Novo Nordisk","The authors thank Anna-marie Sucher-Jones (Diabetes Technology Society) for her expert editorial assistance.

It is essential to understand vaccine hesitancy among SNF workers to inform vaccine campaigns going forward. Objective: To describe the concerns raised among healthcare workers and staff from SNFs during town hall meetings. Design: Sixty-three SNFs from four corporations were invited to send Opinion Leaders, outspoken staff from nursing, nurse aid, dietary, housekeeping or recreational therapy, to attend a 1-h virtual town hall meeting. Meetings used a similar format where the moderator solicited concerns that the attendees themselves had or had heard from others in the facility about the COVID-19 vaccine. Physicians and moderators used personal stories to address concerns and reaffirmed positive emotions. Setting: Twenty-six video town hall meetings with SNF staff. Participants: Healthcare workers and staff, with physicians serving as content experts. Measurement: Questions and comments about the COVID-19 vaccines noted by physicians. Results: One hundred and ninety three staff from 50 facilities participated in 26 meetings between December 30, 2020 and January 15, 2021. Most staff reported getting information about the vaccine from friends or social media. Concerns about how rapidly the vaccines were developed and side effects, including infertility or pregnancy related concerns, were frequently raised. There were no differences in concerns raised by discipline. Questions about returning to prior activities after being vaccinated were common and offered the opportunity to build on positive emotions to reduce vaccine hesitancy. Conclusions: Misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine was widespread among SNF staff. Sharing positive emotions and stories may be more effective than sharing data when attempting to reduce vaccine hesitancy in SNF staff. © 2021 The American Geriatrics Society.",COVID-19; nursing home; vaccine hesitancy,SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; drug information; drug safety; emotion; friend; health care personnel; human; infertility; leadership; misinformation; nursing assistant; nursing home personnel; physician; pregnancy; social media; vaccine hesitancy; videorecording; administration and dosage; interpersonal communication; nursing home; nursing staff; prevention and control; psychology; vaccination refusal; Communication; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Nursing Staff; Physicians; Skilled Nursing Facilities; Vaccination Refusal,"National Institute on Aging, NIA: 3U54AG063546",This work was funded by the National Institute on Aging (3U54AG063546).,NA,NA,NA,NA,28614,33764497,J.

Latinx immigrants, in particular, face significant barriers to SARS-CoV-2 testing, including lack of insurance, language barriers, stigma, work conflicts, and limited transportation. Methods: In response to a disproportionately high SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate among Latinxs at the Johns Hopkins Health System, investigators implemented free community-based testing by partnering with religious leaders and leveraging the skill of trusted community health workers. Data were extracted from the electronic health record and a Research Electronic Data Capture database. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was evaluated per event stratified by race/ethnicity. Total rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity and categorical patient characteristics were compared between groups using chi-square tests. Results: Between June 25, 2020 and October 15, 2020, a total of 1,786 patients (57.5% Latinx, 31.2% non-Hispanic White, 5.9% non-Hispanic Black, and 5.3% non-Hispanic other) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in 18 testing events. Among them, 355 (19.9%) tested positive. The positivity rate was 31.5% for Latinxs, 7.6% for non-Hispanic Blacks, 3.4% for non-Hispanic Whites, and 5.3% for patients of other races/ethnicities. Compared with Latinxs who tested negative, Latinxs who tested positive were more likely to report Spanish as their preferred language (91.6% vs 81.7%, p<0.001), be younger (30.4 vs 33.4 years, p<0.008), and have a larger household size (4.8 vs 4.3 members, p<0.002). Conclusions: Community-based testing identified high levels of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission among primarily Latinxs with limited English proficiency. During this period, the overall positivity rate at this community testing site was almost 10 times higher among Latinxs than among non-Hispanic Whites. © 2021",NA,adult; article; Black person; Caucasian; clergy; electronic health record; ethnicity; female; health auxiliary; household; human; language; limited English proficiency; major clinical study; male; Maryland; nonhuman; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; skill; African American; epidemiology; Maryland; African Americans; Baltimore; COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; Humans; SARS-CoV-2,"National Institutes of Health, NIH: R01 DA045556-04S1",This work was in part supported by the NIH Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics-Underserved Populations initiative (Grant R01 DA045556-04S1).,"The authors would like to acknowledge the John Hopkins GoTeam volunteers, the Latinx outreach team (Alejandra Flores-Miller, Ana Cervantes, Ana Ortega Meza, and Melissa Cuesta), and the support from Alicia Wilson, the Vice President of Economic Development for Johns Hopkins University, and Inez Stewart, the Senior Vice President of Human Resources at Johns Hopkins Medicine.

Limited studies have described the impact of these inequities on rural minorities living in Appalachia. This study investigates factors affecting testing in rural communities. Methods: PCR testing data were obtained for March through September 2020. Spatial regression analyses were fit at the census tract level. Model outcomes included testing and positivity rate. Covariates included rurality, percent Black population, food insecurity, and area deprivation index (a comprehensive indicator of socioeconomic status). Results: Small clusters in coronavirus testing were detected sporadically, while test positivity clustered in mideastern and southwestern WV. In regression analyses, percent food insecurity (IRR = 3.69×109, [796, 1.92×1016]), rurality (IRR=1.28, [1.12, 1.48]), and percent population Black (IRR = 0.88, [0.84, 0.94]) had substantial effects on coronavirus testing. However, only percent food insecurity (IRR = 5.98 × 104, [3.59, 1.07×109]) and percent Black population (IRR = 0.94, [0.90, 0.97]) displayed substantial effects on the test positivity rate. Conclusions: Findings highlight disparities in coronavirus testing among communities with rural minorities.

Design: Matched pairs analysis of nursing homes that had their initial vaccine clinics between December 18, 2020, and January 2, 2021, versus between January 3, 2021, and January 18, 2021. Matched facilities had their initial vaccine clinics between 12 and 16 days apart. Setting and Participants: Two hundred and eighty nursing homes in 21 states owned and operated by the largest long-term care provider in the United States. Measurements: Incident SARS-CoV-2 infections per 100 at-risk residents per week; hospital transfers and/or deaths per 100 residents with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection per day, averaged over a week. Results: The early vaccinated group included 136 facilities with 12,157 residents; the late vaccinated group included 144 facilities with 13,221 residents. After 1 week, early vaccinated facilities had a predicted 2.5 fewer incident SARS-CoV-2 infections per 100 at-risk residents per week (95% CI: 1.2–4.0) compared with what would have been expected based on the experience of the late vaccinated facilities. The rates remained significantly lower for several weeks. Cumulatively over 5 weeks, the predicted reduction in new infections was 5.2 cases per 100 at-risk residents (95% CI: 3.2–7.3). By 5 to 8 weeks post-vaccine clinic, early vaccinated facilities had a predicted 1.1 to 3.8 fewer hospitalizations and/or deaths per 100 infected residents per day, averaged by week than expected based on late vaccinated facilities' experience for a cumulative on average difference of 5 events per 100 infected residents per day. Conclusions: The SARS-CoV-2 vaccines seem to have accelerated the rate of decline of incident infections, morbidity, and mortality in this large multi-state nursing home population. © 2021 The American Geriatrics Society.",death; infections; nursing home; SARS-CoV-2; vaccination,SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; African American; Alzheimer disease; Article; Black person; comparative study; coronavirus disease 2019; death; early intervention; female; human; incidence; infection rate; infection risk; length of stay; long term care; major clinical study; male; morbidity; mortality; multicenter study; nursing home; nursing home patient; risk reduction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social isolation; therapy delay; United States; vaccination; virus pathogenesis; vulnerable population; administration and dosage; aged; epidemiology; hospitalization; nursing home; time factor; vaccination; Aged; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Nursing Homes; SARS-CoV-2; Time Factors; United States; Vaccination,"National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute on Aging, NIA: 3P01AG027296?11S1, 3U54AG063546?02S2; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID: R01AI129709","This research was supported by the National Institute on Aging (3P01AG027296?11S1, PI: Mor; 3U54AG063546?02S2) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (R01AI129709).",Dr Mor reported grants from the National Institute on Aging and personal fees from naviHealth outside the submitted work.

Together, residents and staff constitute the single most vulnerable population in the pandemic. The health of these workers is completely entangled with the health of those they care for. Vaccination of SNF staff is key to increasing uptake of the vaccine, reducing health disparities, and reopening SNFs to visitors. Yet, as the vaccine rollout begins, some SNF staff are declining to be vaccinated. The purpose of this article is to describe reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy reported by staff of skilled nursing facilities and understand factors that could potentially reduce hesitancy. Design: Five virtual focus groups were conducted with staff of SNFs as part of a larger project to improve vaccine uptake. Setting and Participants: Focus groups with 58 staff members were conducted virtually using Zoom. Measures: Focus groups sought to elicit concerns, perspectives, and experiences related to COVID-19 testing and vaccination. Results: Our findings indicate that some SNF staff are hesitant to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Reasons for this hesitancy include beliefs that the vaccine has been developed too fast and without sufficient testing; personal fears about pre-existing medical conditions, and more general distrust of the government. Conclusions and Implications: SNF staff indicate that seeing people like themselves receive the vaccination is more important than seeing public figures. We discuss the vaccination effort as a social enterprise and the need to develop long-term care provider-academic-community partnerships in response to COVID-19 and in expectation of future pandemics. © 2021 AMDA – The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine",COVID-19; skilled nursing facilities; vaccination,SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; fear; female; government; human; information processing; long term care; male; misinformation; nursing home; nursing home patient; nursing home personnel; social media; vaccine hesitancy; COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Skilled Nursing Facilities,"National Institutes of Health, NIH: 3U54AG063546-02S2; National Institute on Aging, NIA","This work was supported through a supplemental award by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number ( 3U54AG063546-02S2 ) to the NIA Imbedded Pragmatic Alzheimer's Disease and AD-Related Dementias Clinical Trials Collaboratory (NIA IMPACT Collaboratory, U54AG063546) as part of the RADx Underserved Populations (RADx-UP) program that supports 32 institutions across the United States to focus on populations disproportionately affected by the pandemic.

The mechanism(s) by which this occurs remains unclear. Methods: We investigated the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 at maternal-fetal interface in pregnant women who tested positive for the virus using RNA in situ hybridization (viral RNA), immunohistochemistry, and hematoxylin and eosin staining. To investigate whether viral infection alters the renin angiotensin system (RAS) in placenta, which controls blood pressure, we treated human trophoblasts with recombinant spike protein or a live modified virus with a vesicular stomatitis viral backbone expressing spike protein (VSV-S). Findings: Viral colonization was highest in maternal decidua, fetal trophoblasts, Hofbauer cells, and in placentas delivered prematurely. We localized SARS-CoV-2 to cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and demonstrate that infected placentas had significantly reduced ACE2. In response to both spike protein and VSV-S, cellular ACE2 decreased although angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) increased with concomitant increase in soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt1). Viral infection decreased pro-angiogenic factors, AT2R, and placental growth factor, which competitively binds to sFlt1. Sera from infected pregnant women had elevated levels of sFlt1 and angiotensin II type 1-receptor autoantibodies prior to delivery, both signatory markers of pre-eclampsia. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 colonizes ACE2-expressing maternal and fetal cells in the placenta. Infection in pregnant women correlates with alteration of placental RAS. As RAS regulates blood pressure, SARS-CoV-2 infection may thus increase adverse hemodynamic outcomes, such as pre-eclampsia in pregnant women.

With the ongoing large-scale vaccination in different countries and continuous surge of new variants of global concerns, a convenient, cost-effective and high-throughput neutralization test is urgently needed. Conventional SARS-CoV-2 neutralization test is tedious, time-consuming and requires a biosafety level 3 laboratory. Despite recent reports of neutralizations using different pseudoviruses with a luciferase or green fluorescent protein reporter, the laborious steps, inter-assay variability or high background limit their high-throughput potential. In this study we generated lentivirus-based pseudoviruses containing a monomeric infrared fluorescent protein reporter to develop neutralization assays. Similar tropism, infection kinetics and mechanism of entry through receptor-mediated endocytosis were found in the three pseudoviruses generated. Compared with pseudovirus D614, pseudovirus with D614G mutation had decreased shedding and higher density of S1 protein present on particles. The 50% neutralization titers to pseudoviruses D614 or D614G correlated with the plaque reduction neutralization titers to live SARS-CoV-2. The turn-around time of 48–72 h, minimal autofluorescence, one-step image quantification, expandable to 384-well, sequential readouts and dual quantifications by flow cytometry support its high-throughput and versatile applications at a non-reference and biosafety level 2 laboratory, in particular for assessing the neutralization sensitivity of new variants by sera from natural infection or different vaccinations during our fight against the pandemic. © 2021 The Author(s).

Objective: This analysis was carried out at a granular spatial resolution of census tracts to explore the spatial patterns and contextual SDOH associated with COVID-19 incidence from a Hispanic population mostly consisting of a Mexican American population living in Cameron County, Texas on the border of the United States and Mexico. We performed age-stratified analysis to identify different contributing SDOH and quantify their effects by age groups. Methods: We included all reported COVID-19–positive cases confirmed by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction testing between March 18 (first case reported) and December 16, 2020, in Cameron County, Texas. Confirmed COVID-19 cases were aggregated to weekly counts by census tracts. We adopted a Bayesian spatiotemporal negative binomial model to investigate the COVID-19 incidence rate in relation to census tract demographics and SDOH obtained from the American Community Survey. Moreover, we investigated the impact of local mitigation policy on COVID-19 by creating the binary variable “shelter-in-place.” The analysis was performed on all COVID-19–confirmed cases and age-stratified subgroups. Results: Our analysis revealed that the relative incidence risk (RR) of COVID-19 was higher among census tracts with a higher percentage of single-parent households (RR=1.016, 95% posterior credible intervals [CIs] 1.005, 1.027) and a higher percentage of the population with limited English proficiency (RR=1.015, 95% CI 1.003, 1.028). Lower RR was associated with lower income (RR=0.972, 95% CI 0.953, 0.993) and the percentage of the population younger than 18 years (RR=0.976, 95% CI 0.959, 0.993). The most significant association was related to the “shelter-in-place” variable, where the incidence risk of COVID-19 was reduced by over 50%, comparing the time periods when the policy was present versus absent (RR=0.506, 95% CI 0.454, 0.563). Moreover, age-stratified analyses identified different significant contributing factors and a varying magnitude of the “shelter-in-place” effect. Conclusions: In our study, SDOH including social environment and local emergency measures were identified in relation to COVID-19 incidence risk at the census tract level in a highly disadvantaged population with limited health care access and a high prevalence of chronic conditions. Results from our analysis provide key knowledge to design efficient testing strategies and assist local public health departments in COVID-19 control, mitigation, and implementation of vaccine strategies. ©Cici Bauer, Kehe Zhang, Miryoung Lee, Susan Fisher-Hoch, Esmeralda Guajardo, Isela de la Cerda, Isela de la Cerda, Maria E Fernandez, Belinda Reininger.",Bayesian; COVID-19; Health inequity; Social determinants of health; Spatial pattern; Underserved population,"adolescent; adult; aged; epidemiology; ethnology; female; health equity; Hispanic; human; incidence; male; Mexico; middle aged; minority group; population research; social determinants of health; socioeconomics; spatial analysis; Texas; United States; very elderly; vulnerable population; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Censuses; COVID-19; Female; Health Equity; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Incidence; Male; Mexico; Middle Aged; Minority Groups; Physical Distancing; SARS-CoV-2; Social Determinants of Health; Socioeconomic Factors; Spatial Analysis; Texas; United States; Vulnerable Populations; Young Adult","National Institutes of Health, NIH: 3UL1TR003167-02S1",This study was partially supported by National Institutes of Health funding 3UL1TR003167-02S1.,NA,NA,NA,NA,23692960,34081608,JMIR Publ.

Vaccine trials excluded nursing home (NH) residents, limiting adverse event data that directly apply to this population. Methods: To prospectively monitor for potential adverse events associated with vaccination, we used Electronic Health Record (EHR) data from Genesis HealthCare, the largest NH provider in the United States. EHR data on vaccinations and pre-specified adverse events were updated daily and monitored for signal detection among residents of 147 facilities who received the first dose of vaccine between December 18, 2020 and January 3, 2021. For comparison, unvaccinated residents during the same time period were included from 137 facilities that started vaccinating at least 15 days after the vaccinating-facilities. Results: As of January 3, 2021, 8553 NH residents had received one dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and by February 20, 2021, 8371 residents had received their second dose of vaccine; 11,072 were included in the unvaccinated comparator group. No significant associations were noted for neurologic outcomes, anaphylaxis, or cardiac events. Conclusions: No major safety problems were detected following the first or second dose of the vaccine to prevent COVID-19 in the study cohort from December 18, 2020 through March 7, 2021. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines; Skilled nursing facilities; Vaccine safety monitoring,"RNA vaccine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; messenger RNA; acute heart infarction; aged; Article; Bell palsy; cohort analysis; comparative study; coronavirus disease 2019; drug safety; electronic health record; female; human; lung embolism; major clinical study; male; nursing home; nursing home patient; patient monitoring; prospective study; United States; vaccination; venous thromboembolism; nursing home; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Nursing Homes; RNA, Messenger; SARS-CoV-2; United States; Vaccination","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC: 3P01AG027296-11S1; National Institute on Aging, NIA: 5U54AG063546-02S5","This research was supported, in part, by a grant from the National Institute on Aging [5U54AG063546-02S5] with supplemental funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under an inter-agency agreement, and another grant from the National Institute on Aging [3P01AG027296-11S1].

Objective: To explore the experiences of Black and Latinx communities during the pandemic to better understand their perspectives on COVID-19 mitigation behaviors (eg, mask wearing), testing, and vaccines. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this community-engaged qualitative study conducted with 18 community-based organizations and 4 health care organizations between November 19, 2020, and February 5, 2021, in New Jersey counties severely affected by the pandemic, group and individual interviews were used to purposively sample 111 Black and Latinx individuals. A total of 13 group interviews were organized by race/ethnicity and language: 4 English-speaking groups with Black participants (n = 34), 3 Spanish-speaking groups with Latinx participants (n = 24), and 4 English-speaking groups with Black and Latinx participants (n = 36). To understand the views of health care workers from these communities, 2 additional groups (n = 9) were convened and supplemented with individual interviews. Main Outcomes and Measures: Description of Black and Latinx participants' experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic and their perspectives on mitigation behaviors, testing, and vaccines. Results: The study included 111 participants (87 women [78.4%]; median age, 43 years [range, 18-93 years]). Participants described the devastating effects of the pandemic on themselves, loved ones, and their community. Their experiences were marked by fear, illness, loss, and separation. These experiences motivated intense information seeking, mitigation behaviors, and testing. Nevertheless, vaccine skepticism was high across all groups. Participants did not trust the vaccine development process and wanted clearer information. Black participants expressed that they did not want to be subjects of experiments. Conclusions and Relevance: The remaining unknowns about new vaccines need to be acknowledged and described for Black and Latinx communities to make informed decisions. Ultimately, scientists and public officials need to work transparently to address unanswered questions and work collaboratively with trusted community leaders and health professionals to foster partnered approaches, rather than focusing on marketing campaigns, to eliminate vaccine skepticism.. © 2021 American Medical Association.

Methods: An extended susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) compartmental model was used to simulate COVID-19 spread when considering diagnosis, isolation, and vaccination of a cohort of 1 million individuals. The scenarios modeled represented 4 pandemic severity scenarios and various times when the vaccine becomes available during the pandemic. Eligible individuals have a probability p of receiving antibody testing prior to vaccination (p = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1). The vaccine was modeled as a single dose vaccine with 90% and 70% efficacy. The value of serology testing was evaluated by comparing the infection attack rate, peak infections, peak day, and deaths. Results: The use of antibody testing to prioritize the allocation of limited vaccines reduces infection attack rates and deaths. The size of the reduction depends on when the vaccine becomes available relative to the infection peak day. The largest percentage reduction in cases and deaths occurs when the vaccine is deployed before and close to the infection peak day. The reduction in the number of cases and deaths diminishes as vaccine deployment is delayed. Conclusions: Antibody testing as part of the vaccination plan is an effective method to maximize the benefit of a COVID-19 vaccine. Decision-makers need to consider relative timing between the infection peak day and when the vaccine becomes available. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Antibody testing; COVID-19; Natural immunity; Resource allocation; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination,SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; vaccine; Article; attack rate; cohort analysis; compartment model; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19 serological testing; death; drug bioavailability; drug efficacy; human; isolation; pandemic; probability; resource allocation; serology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; simulation; susceptible infected recovered; susceptible population; vaccination; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Vaccines,"National Institutes of Health, NIH; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK: NU38OT000297, P30DK111024-05S1; Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, CSTE; Georgia Department of Public Health, DPH","This work was supported in part by the RADx-UP NIH/NIDDK grant (P30DK111024-05S1), the Cooperative Agreement number NU38OT000297 from The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and CSTE, and the following Georgia Tech benefactors: William W.

In this brief report, we describe interventions that Genesis HealthCare—one of the largest US long-term care providers—implemented after recognizing midway through vaccinations that racial and ethnic disparities existed in vaccine uptake among employees, with black and Hispanic employees having significantly lower rates of vaccination than their peers. Specifically, Genesis engaged its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Committee to identify ways to augment its already comprehensive vaccine education campaign in order to build confidence among employees from minority communities. Interventions implemented beginning in late January 2021 included adding DEI representatives to information sessions to facilitate culturally sensitive discussions; holding information sessions at all times of day and night, and inviting employees’ family members to join; increasing availability of multilingual educational materials; and featuring DEI representatives in social media campaigns. Between the end of January and beginning of March 2021, we observed statistically significant improvements in the likelihood of black and Hispanic employees being vaccinated relative to white employees, calculated as the relative risk of vaccination, suggesting a reduction in vaccination disparity. Whether these trends are directly related to the organization's efforts, or rather reflect individuals needing longer to become comfortable with the vaccines, is difficult to discern in the absence of a formal pragmatic trial. Still, these findings support the continuation of targeted educational and engagement efforts to improve vaccine uptake among staff, and the critical need to ensure that nursing homes have ongoing access to vaccine supply to continue their vaccination programs. © 2021 AMDA – The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine",COVID-19; long-term care; Nursing Home; vaccines; workforce,SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adult; African American; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; employee; Hispanic; human; long term care; nursing home patient; nursing home personnel; racial disparity; social media; trust; vaccination; nursing home; trust; United States; vaccination; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Nursing Homes; SARS-CoV-2; Trust; United States; Vaccination,"National Institute on Aging, NIA: 3P01AG027296-11S1","This study was supported by the National Institute on Aging ( 3P01AG027296-11S1 , PI: Vincent Mor U54063546-S5, MPI: Vincent Mor, Sarah Berry)",NA,NA,NA,NA,15258610,34375655,J.

Our study objective was to evaluate the perceptions of COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy in a sample of frontline HCAs, overall and by race and ethnicity. Methods: An online survey was conducted from December 2020 to January 2021 through national e-mail listserv and private Facebook page for the National Association of Health Care Assistants. Responses from 155 HCAs, including certified nursing assistants, home health aides, certified medical assistants, and certified medication technicians, were included. A 27-item survey asked questions about experiences and perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines, including how confident they were that COVID-19 vaccines are safe, effective, and adequately tested in people of color. Multivariable regression was used to identify associations with confidence in COVID-19 vaccines. Results: We analyzed data from 155 completed responses. Among respondents, 23.9% were black and 8.4% Latino/a. Most respondents worked in the nursing home setting (53.5%), followed by hospitals (12.9%), assisted living (11.6%), and home care (10.3%). Respondents expressed low levels of confidence in COVID-19 vaccines, with fewer than 40% expressing at least moderate confidence in safety (38.1%), effectiveness (31.0%), or adequate testing in people of color (27.1%). Non-white respondents reported lower levels of confidence in adequate testing of vaccines compared to white respondents. In bivariate and adjusted models, respondents who gave more favorable scores of organizational leadership at their workplace expressed greater confidence in COVID-19 vaccines. Conclusion: Frontline HCAs reported low confidence in COVID-19 vaccines. Stronger organizational leadership in the workplace appears to be an important factor in influencing HCA's willingness to be vaccinated. Action is needed to enhance COVID-19 vaccine uptake in this important population with employers playing an important role to build vaccine confidence and trust among employees. © 2021 The American Geriatrics Society.",NA,influenza vaccine; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adult; aged; Alaska Native; American Indian; Article; Asian American; assisted living facility; Black person; Caucasian; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; drug efficacy; drug safety; e-mail; ethnicity; female; health care personnel; Hispanic; home care; hospital; human; leadership; major clinical study; male; medical assistant; multiracial person; Native Hawaiian; nursing assistant; nursing home; Pacific Islander; paramedical personnel; perception; race; social media; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; workplace; administration and dosage; ancestry group; Internet; middle aged; paramedical personnel; prevention and control; psychology; questionnaire; Adult; Aged; Allied Health Personnel; Assisted Living Facilities; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Ethnicity; Female; Hospitals; Humans; Internet; Male; Middle Aged; Nursing Homes; Perception; Racial Groups; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vaccination; Vaccination Hesitancy,"K24 AG070106; National Institutes of Health, NIH: U54AG063546; National Institute on Aging, NIA","This work was supported through a supplemental award by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number 3U54AG063546?02S2 to the NIA Imbedded Pragmatic Alzheimer's Disease and AD?Related Dementias Clinical Trials Collaboratory (NIA IMPACT Collaboratory, U54AG063546) as part of the RADx Underserved Populations (RADx?UP) program, which supports 32 institutions across the United States to focus on populations disproportionately affected by the pandemic.

However, less is known about transmission in schools for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), who are often unable to mask or maintain social distancing. The objectives of this study were to determine SARS-CoV-2 positivity and in-school transmission rates using weekly screening tests for school staff and students and describe the concurrent deployment of mitigation strategies in six schools for children with IDD. Methods: From November 23, 2020, to May, 28, 2021, weekly voluntary screening for SARS-CoV-2 with a high sensitivity molecular-based saliva test was offered to school staff and students. Weekly positivity rates were determined and compared to local healthcare system and undergraduate student screening data. School-based transmission was assessed among participants quarantined for in-school exposure. School administrators completed a standardized survey to assess school mitigation strategies. Results: A total of 59 students and 416 staff participated. An average of 304 school staff and students were tested per week. Of 7289 tests performed, 21 (0.29%) new SARS-CoV-2 positive cases were identified. The highest weekly positivity rate was 1.2% (n = 4) across all schools, which was less than community positivity rates. Two cases of in-school transmission were identified, each among staff, representing 2% (2/103) of participants quarantined for in-school exposure. Mitigation strategies included higher than expected student mask compliance, reduced room capacity, and phased reopening. Conclusions: During 24 weeks that included the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in winter 2020-21, we found lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 screening test positivity among staff and students of six schools for children with IDD compared to community rates. In-school transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was low among those quarantined for in-school exposure. However, the impact of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant on the effectiveness of these proven mitigation strategies remains unknown.
